# Task-Management-Program	

This is a simple task management program written in Python. 

The program allows users to login with their credentials and choose from a set of options that include registering a new user, adding a new task, viewing all tasks, viewing user's tasks, displaying statistics, and exiting the program. 

The program uses text files to store user information and task information. The program has a login system that reads the user's credentials from a file, checks if they are correct, and then allows the user to proceed to the main menu. 

The program also has an option for the admin to add a new user to the user database. The program allows users to add tasks and view tasks that are assigned to them. The program displays statistics such as the total number of tasks and the number of completed tasks.
